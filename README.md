# Stellar-Classification
Developed a Random Forest classifier to classify stars based on photometric data (u, g, r, i, z). The project involved data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix. It demonstrates machine learning application in astronomy.
